    trajectory_length: "Trajectory Length: the total “distance” traveled in latent space by a single video’s latent. We compute this by summing the stepwise Euclidean distances between consecutive latent states: Length = ∑<sub>t</sub> ||x<sub>t+1</sub> – x<sub>t</sub>||. A group’s mean trajectory length (with standard deviation) indicates how far, on average, the latents move from start to finish for that prompt 1 2 . Longer trajectories suggest more significant changes or added detail over the denoising process.",
    velocity_analysis: "Velocity: the speed of movement through latent space per diffusion step. For each video, we calculate velocity at each step as the norm of the step difference v<sub>t</sub> = ||x<sub>t+1</sub> – x<sub>t</sub>||. We then compute the mean velocity (average of these norms over all steps) and the velocity variance (variance of the step sizes over time) 3 4 . Intuitively, mean velocity tells us on average how fast the latent is changing at each step, and velocity variance indicates whether the speed is steady or varies (e.g. perhaps fast changes early and slow later). We often aggregate velocity statistics per prompt group – for example, we report each group’s overall mean of mean- velocities across videos, and similarly an overall mean of velocity variances.", 
    acceleration_analysis: "Acceleration: the change in velocity between steps. We define a step’s acceleration as the norm of the difference between consecutive velocity vectors: a<sub>t</sub> = v<sub>t+1</sub> – v<sub>t</ sub>, and then take its norm ||a<sub>t</sub>||. We compute mean acceleration (average ||a|| over time) and acceleration variance for each video 5 6 . High acceleration means the velocity itself is changing rapidly (the trajectory might be speeding up or slowing down erratically). This could indicate “jolts” in the generative process (possibly corresponding to phase changes, as discussed later).",
    tortuosity: "Tortuosity (Circuitousness): how indirect or meandering the path is. We quantify this as circuitousness = trajectory length / endpoint distance 9 10 . A value of 1.0 would mean the trajectory was a straight line from start to finish. Larger values indicate a winding path. We record the mean tortuousity per group (and sometimes the distribution of this metric across videos) 11 . This is an important metric for understanding how efficiently the model gets to the final image – do latents wander around (high circuitousness) or move straight toward the solution (low circuitousness)?",
    endpoint_distance: "Endpoint Distance: the straight-line distance between the initial and final latent in a trajectory. This is simply ||x_final – x_initial|| for a video 7 8 . It tells us how far the final representation is from where it started (noise). This is always ≤ trajectory length, and the ratio gives the Circuitousness (defined below). The group mean endpoint distance is often smaller than mean trajectory length, since the path is not straight.",
